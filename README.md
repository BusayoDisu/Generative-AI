### PROJECT TITLE: "Optimizing Home Design Brilliance: Fine-tuning the Stable Diffusion Model for Clavis Studio in Edmonton with PyTorch Magic"
Welcome to my personal project.

### Problem Statement
"Clavis Studio faces the challenge of bridging the imaginative gap between clients' visions and tangible design concepts. In response to this, there is a pressing need for an advanced generative AI solution, leveraging text-to-image capabilities, to empower Clavis Studio in translating client preferences and ideas into visually compelling and accurate home design representations."

### Solution
"Implementing a state-of-the-art generative AI, such as the Stable Diffusion Model fine-tuned with PyTorch, Clavis Studio can seamlessly transform client-provided textual descriptions into vivid and personalized home design images, revolutionizing the communication and visualization process."
